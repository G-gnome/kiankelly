										<h3>About me</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://igg.ucdavis.edu/"> Integrative Genetics and Genomics </a> at UC Davis in <a href="http://phylogenomics.me/"> Dr. Jonathan Eisen’s </a>laboratory. I received my B. A. in Molecular and Cell Biology with a Genetics, Genomics and Development emphasis from UC Berkeley in the spring of 2013. While at UC Berkeley I participated in research in <a href="http://www.simmslab.org/wp/">Dr. Ellen Simms’ </a>lab on multiple projects involving rhizobia-legume symbiosis. My current research interests include plant-microbe interactions, the co-evolution of microbes and their hosts, and marine fungi.</p>
