<p>It has been the privilege for the Eisen lab to host Henna Hundal, a high school senior, <a href="http://www.voiceamerica.com/show/2014/express-yourself">radio show host</a> and soon-to-be certified yoga instructor, on a six-week summer research project. Henna was part of UC Davis' prestigious <a href="http://ysp.ucdavis.edu/">Young Scholars Program</a>.</p>

<p>For the wet lab portion of Henna's project, she focused on the Seagrass Microbiome which involved growing and isolating microbes from seawater on LB that she helped collect from tanks of <em>Zostera marina</em> at Bodega Bay.</p>

<p>As part of the Young Scholar's Program, Henna had to make a scientific poster of her intended project, write a 10-30 page final paper and give a 10 minute presentation on her project. For extra credit (because Henna was magnificently studious) she also turned her powerpoint presentation into a makeshift poster.</p>
<p>The best explanation of Henna's summer project was the one that Henna gave herself. As an experienced radio show host, Henna was a natural presenter. Henna's final presentation was recorded and can be viewed: <strong><a href="http://new.livestream.com/accounts/4879011/events/3227492/videos/58016281">HERE</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As a whole, we are unbelievably proud of the work that Henna did while in the lab and would be happy to have her back anytime! She is an amazing young scientist and effective science communicator and we have no doubt about her future success! So congratulations Henna on being made of awesome!</p>
