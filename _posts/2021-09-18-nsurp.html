<p>

I mentored Neptali this summer through <a href="https://nsurp.org/">NSURP</a> to work on a project identifing viruses associated with cyanobacteria using KBase. A video Neptali made based on their work was featured on the National Research Mentoring Network website! <a href="https://nrmnet.net/blog/2021/09/17/mentees-collaborating-with-their-mentors-for-undergrad-research-programs/">You can read the featured post here. </a>

Alternatively, you can watch Neptali's video below!
