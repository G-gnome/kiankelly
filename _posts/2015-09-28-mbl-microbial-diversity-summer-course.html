<p>I spent this past summer at the MBL Microbial Diversity summer course and I've written a post about it which can be found here: <a href="http://microbe.net/2015/09/28/mbl-microbial-diversity-summer-course/">http://microbe.net/2015/09/28/mbl-microbial-diversity-summer-course/</a></p>
<p>While at the course, I also cultured a handful of microbes from seagrass leafs/roots and several different amoeba from seagrass bed sediments as well as Labyrinthula.</p>
