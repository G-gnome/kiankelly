This post is adapted from a blog post I wrote for my advanced soil microbiology graduate class.<br /><br />For the class we discussed the resilience of soil microbes to change based on the rainfall study done by<a href="https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/attachment/49975fda-586e-462c-a5c0-37aa4898edf8/Announcements/48e39914-069b-4f47-99ad-fcdc7ec563a4/Rainfall%20Effects%20Banfield%20_2.pdf"> <b>Banfield et al (2009).</b></a> Our discussion reminded me of a talk I'd recently seen by Lawrence  David from Duke University on the human gut microbiome. His talk was on  his recent Genome Biology paper: <b><a href="http://genomebiology.com/content/pdf/gb-2014-15-7-r89.pdf"><i>Host lifestyle affects human microbiota on daily timescales</i></a>.</b> The paper follows two subjects (rumor has it these subjects were  Lawrence and his PhD professor, Eric Alm) for a little less than a year.  The subjects collected a ton of metadata along with their samples  including diet. The study found that overall the subjects gut microbiota  were stable and relatively unchanging. Despite the plethora of metadata  they were only able to correlate a few different factors to the  presence or absence of certain OTU's.<br /><br />However, the  authors were able to observe two large changes in the microbial gut  communities of the subjects. Subject A traveled to Southeast Asia and as  his diet drastically changed so did his gut microbiota. However, upon  return from Southeast Asia, his gut community returned to the original  community after two weeks. Subject B had food poisoning resulting in a  drastic change to his gut microbiota. Subject B's gut microbiota never  fully went back to the original community - however only 1.3% of reads  post-infection were from new taxa and most of the community was closely  related to the original community which the authors concluded was the  result of a conservation of function over the conservation of specific  species.<br /><br />Sampling every day especially when dealing  with the human gut, is a huge enterprise (hence the n of 2). However,  Lawrence David et al were able to observe changes to the microbial gut  communities of the subjects and the return of these communities to a  stable state only because of the frequency of sampling that they did. In  the Banfield et al study on grassland soil, they sampled only four  times a year for two years. They did see the microbial communities  change at two time points, but these changes had disappeared by the next  time point indicating microbial resilience.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n5f-ghqKR-E/VD31U7mx1eI/AAAAAAAACrE/jnjlb3zPoy8/s1600/soils2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n5f-ghqKR-E/VD31U7mx1eI/AAAAAAAACrE/jnjlb3zPoy8/s1600/soils2.png" height="214" width="320" /></a></div><br />Although these two studies involve different environments (human gut vs. soil), they both bring up a good question: <b>How  often should we sample microbial communities to observe changes to  community composition (temporary or permanent)? Across days? Across  years? Across decades? </b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>For those interested in learning more about the human microbiome, at the time of the class there was a<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/microbiome"> <b>coursera course offered by Rob Knight's lab on it.</b></a> Also if you are unfamiliar with alpha and beta diversity; I like these lecture slides on <b><a href="https://edamame-course.github.io/docs/extra/Presentations/2014-08-14-AM_Ashley_Lecture2.pdf?raw=true">alpha diversity</a></b> and <b><a href="https://edamame-course.github.io/docs/extra/Presentations/2014-08-14-PM_Ashley_Lecture3.pdf?raw=true">beta diversity</a></b>.
