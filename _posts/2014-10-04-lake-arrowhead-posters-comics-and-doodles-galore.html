<p>Two weeks or so ago, Hannah and I presented posters on our respective seagrass microbiome work at the<strong><a href="http://www.mimg.ucla.edu/arrowhead2014/index.html"> Lake Arrowhead Microbial Genomics meeting</a></strong>. Attending the meeting was a wonderful experience for both of us and the talks and people were just phenomenal! For a brief overview of each day and the accompanying storify see: <strong><a href="http://microbe.net/2014/09/16/report-and-storify-from-lake-arrowhead-microbial-genomics-day-1/">Day 1</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://microbe.net/2014/09/17/report-and-storify-from-lake-arrowhead-day-2/">Day 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://microbe.net/2014/09/18/report-and-storify-from-lake-arrowhead-day-3/">Day 3</a>. <a href="http://microbe.net/2014/09/27/lake-arrowhead-microbial-genomics-2014-lamg14-f1000-site-w-posters-and-talks/">Some of the talks and posters were uploaded to F1000.</a></strong></p>

<p>On the left you can see me dutifully standing in front of my poster. On the right you can see Hannah explaining her poster to a fellow LAMG-er! Hannah's poster is one of the ones uploaded to F1000 and can be found <strong><a href="http://f1000.com/posters/browse/summary/1096751">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>My poster can be seen below - I took inspiration from comic books when coming up with the design.</p>

<p>Of course, taking inspiration from comic books then meant I was obligated to produce a comic version of my poster which you can see below!</p>
