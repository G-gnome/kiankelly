<p>
As an ASAPbio 2021 Fellow, my group worked to create a guide that helps and empowers early career researchers (ECRs) regarding preprinting. <a href="https://osf.io/e59tk/">That guide is now available online as a preprint on OSF Preprints </a>. We also wrote a summary here for the ASAPbio blog: <a href="https://asapbio.org/guide-to-preprinting-for-early-career-researchers"> https://asapbio.org/guide-to-preprinting-for-early-career-researchers </a> 

Briefly in our preprint, we focus on the following topics:
(1) What are preprints?
(2) How are different disciplines in the life sciences engaging with preprints?
(3) How to approach conversations about preprints with co-authors?
(4) What concerns may come up in conversations about preprints? 
(5) What are practical steps for depositing a preprint?
(6) What are other ways to get involved with preprints?
