<p>tl;dr - The microbes (bacteria) on plant parts  (root, leaf) and near-by sediment were different from each other. We did not find a difference between the microbes on  eelgrass leaves or roots at the edge of a patch versus the middle of the patch. However, the microbes in sediments from different locations in the patch (middle, edge, outside of the patch) differed and these differences correlated with eelgrass density.</p>

<p class="heading"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><i>Zostera marina</i> (also known as eelgrass) is a foundation species in coastal and marine ecosystems worldwide and is a model for studies of seagrasses (a paraphyletic group in the order <i>Alismatales</i>) that include all the known fully submerged marine angiosperms. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation of the potential importance of the microbial communities (i.e., microbiomes) associated with various plant species. Here we report a study of variation in <i>Z. marina</i> microbiomes from a field site in Bodega Bay, CA.</section>

<p class="heading"><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p class="heading">We characterized and then compared the microbial communities of root, leaf and sediment samples (using 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR and sequencing) and associated environmental parameters from the inside, edge and outside of a single subtidal <i>Z. marina</i> patch. Multiple comparative approaches were used to examine associations between microbiome features (e.g., diversity, taxonomic composition) and environmental parameters and to compare sample types and sites.</p>
</section>
<section class="sec">
<p class="heading"><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="heading">Microbial communities differed significantly between sample types (root, leaf and sediment) and in sediments from different sites (inside, edge, outside). Carbon:Nitrogen ratio and eelgrass density were both significantly correlated to sediment community composition. Enrichment of certain taxonomic groups in each sample type was detected and analyzed in regard to possible functional implications (especially regarding sulfur metabolism).</p>

<section class="sec">
<p class="heading"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="heading">Our results are mostly consistent with prior work on seagrass associated microbiomes with a few differences and additional findings. From a functional point of view, the most significant finding is that many of the taxa that differ significantly between sample types and sites are closely related to ones commonly associated with various aspects of sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. Though not a traditional model organism, we believe that <i>Z. marina</i> can become a model for studies of marine plant-microbiome interactions.</p>
