<p> <br> A series of projects investigating the potential biotic and abiotic drivers of microbiome assembly in seagrass beds including observing (1) differences across locations within a seagrass patch, (2) differences related to proximity to a marina and (3) succession during ammonification. </p>

										<h4><strong>(1) Seagrass microbiome variation at patch edge</strong></h4>
									</header>
									<p>In our paper, we found that <a href="">"Microbial communities in sediment from Zostera marina patches, but not the Z. marina leaf or root microbiomes, vary in relation to distance from patch edge"</a>.</p>

											<h4><strong>(2) Effect of marina proximity on seagrass microbiome</strong></h4>
										</header>
					
										<p> As part of a larger project looking at tunicate abundance by Sofie Voerman, I looked at the effect of distance from the marina on the microbiome. The RMarkdown file for the analysis can be found on <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Marina_proximity_16S_rRNA_gene_amplicon_analysis/6998636"> Figshare. </a> </p>

											<h4><strong>(3) Ammonification in seagrass sediments</strong></h4>
										</header>
										<p>In our paper, <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/3674/">"Microbiome succession during ammonification in eelgrass bed sediments"</a>, we observed microbial community succession related to sulfur cycling, but could find no correlation between the community and rates of ammonification. </p>
