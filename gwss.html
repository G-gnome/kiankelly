										<h3><strong>Glassy-winged Sharpshooter
</strong></h3> </header>


<div class="row">


<div class="6u">
<p> <i>Homalodisca vitripennis </i>, aka the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a xylem feeding leafhopper, invasive to California and an important agricultural pest as a vector of <i>Xylella fastidiosa </i>. For part of my postdoc work with Dr. Jason Stajich, I am working on genome improvements, as well as investigating genomic mechanisms that might lead to insecticide resistance.

Our first manuscript related to our genome improvement work, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab255">" Improved draft reference genome for the Glassy-winged Sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis), a vector for Pierceâ€™s disease"</a> is now out in G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics.
