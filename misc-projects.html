										<h3><strong>Miscellaneous projects
</strong></h3> </header>

<p>These projects involve turning existing, but long forgotten, datasets into thoughtful and useful analyses. Currently these include (1) metagenomic data from hot springs in Kamchatka, Russia and (2) metagenomic data from aquariums. </p>

<p>This project is a collaboration with <a href="https://laetitia.schmid.se/">Laetitia Wilkins</a>. Our preprint is available on bioRxiv: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/15/392308">"There and back again: metagenome-assembled genomes provide new insights into two thermal pools in Kamchatka, Russia"</a></p>

<header> <h4><strong>(2) Metagenomic data from aquariums</strong></h4></header>
<p>In collaboration with other members of the Eisen lab, I have assembled metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from metagenomic sequencing data from several different types of aquariums. Several of these MAGs are of great interest to us, and we are currently working hard to analyze the data.</p>
