										<h3><strong>Miscellaneous projects
</strong></h3> </header>

<p>These projects involve turning existing, but long forgotten, datasets into thoughtful and useful analyses. Currently these include (1) metagenomic data from hot springs in Kamchatka, Russia and (2) metagenomic data from aquariums. </p>

<p>This project was a collaboration with <a href="https://www.ecoevoint.ch/">Laetitia Wilkins</a>. Our paper was published in Scientific Reports: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39576-6">"Metagenome-assembled genomes provide new insight into the microbial diversity of two thermal pools in Kamchatka, Russia"</a></p>

<header> <h4><strong>(2) Metagenomic data from aquariums</strong></h4></header>
<p>In collaboration with other members of the Eisen lab, I assembled metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from metagenomic sequencing data from several different types of aquariums. We have now made these MAGs available as a community resouce, see our preprint on bioRxiv <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.28.446213v1">Reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes from aquaria</a>.</p>
